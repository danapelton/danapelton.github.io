      <p class="mb-4">
        I’m a strategic executive operations leader with a passion for helping senior executives lead with clarity, focus, and impact. I’ve supported visionary C-suite leaders — including the former COOs of Virgin Atlantic and Delta Air Lines — across startups and global organizations such as GitLab, Cruise, and other mission-driven companies. My experience spans board-level coordination, strategic initiative support, internal communications, and culture-building at scale.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        What sets me apart isn’t just my operational strength — it’s the way I lead with intuition, discretion, and a deep care for people. I solve problems before they surface, design systems that make work smoother, and bring warmth into the room even during high-pressure moments. I check on team members when they’re quiet. I keep executives grounded in what matters most. And I make sure no one feels like they’re doing it alone.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        After years of being “more than an EA,” I’m stepping fully into the strategic partner I’ve always been. I’m not chasing a title — I’m looking for a mission to support and a team where my presence makes a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re building something bold and need a steady, thoughtful right hand who brings clarity, connection, and action — I’d love to connect.
      </p>
